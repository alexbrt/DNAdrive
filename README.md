_Making data storage in bacteria possible._ ðŸŒŸ  

---

* An implementation of a simple yet efficient coding algorithm which converts binary data into customized strings of nucleotides called protospacers, carefully crafted to follow every specification of the CRISPR-Cas type I-E immune system in order to ensure their integration into the CRISPR locus.  

* Developed as a proof of concept for several science competitions and seminars.

## Documentation

_The full formal specification of the encoding scheme is coming soon. Official paper can be found in /docs._
